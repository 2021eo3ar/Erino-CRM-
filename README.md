## Reason For use MongoDB over PostgreSQL 
For this particular project PostgreSQL was a suitable chloice but because the of the time given for complition of the project and for making the project on time I found MongoDB a better choice, because of its easy setup, and go to nature
And yes I use MONGODB Atals for this project.

## Challenges I found while making this Project
So setting up frontend and making it working smooth with all the functionalities was a bit tough task for me, But I tried to make it as perfect as asked in the assignment, styling it and setting up its Responsivness was a major task to achieve.
At last I learnt about Material UI and Redux Toolkit with this project, Thankyou for this opporutnity.
